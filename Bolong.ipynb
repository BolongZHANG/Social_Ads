    "Social relationship-based advertising (i.e., social advertising) has become one of the fastest growing categories of advertising in the Internet advertising industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tencent Social Ads is the advertising arm of Chinese internet giant Tencent. Through the platform, it’s possible for clients to target users on Wechat (also known as Weixin), QQ and QZone, and other Tencent platforms. Advertisers claim to reach around 900 million users through Tencent in 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge comes from a real advertising product in Tencent's social advertising business - Lookalike. The purpose of this product is to identify other users who are similar to the target users from a large number of people based on the target data provided by the advertiser. In the actual case, Lookalike can help advertisers find potential consumers similar to existing consumers based on the existing data of advertisers, which finally helps to explore new customers and expand their business.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lookalike automatically calculates a similar population (called an extended population) based on a seed population (also known as a seed package) provided by the advertiser.\n",
    "We will provide you with hundreds of seed populations, user features of a large number of candidate groups, and the advertisement features of the seed population. For the sake of business data security assurance, all data is desensitized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire data set is divided into training set and test set. The training set calibrates the users who belong to the seed package and the users who do not (i.e., positive and negative samples). The test set will detect if your algorithm can accurately classify the users into corresponding seed package in the test set. The seed packages in the training set and the test set are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test whether your algorithm can well understand the user and the seed population, you are required to provide the scores of candidate users belonging to each seed package in the test set (the higher the score, the more likely the candidate is a potential user of a package).
